            <h2>My name is Tanvir and I live a simple life</h2>
            <p>Hola! I am <strong>Tanvir Khan.</strong> By profession, I am a software engineer. In 2015, I decided to come to Canada for completing my undergraduation
                from Simon Fraser University. It was one of the best learning experiences. Coming from a third world country, I can say there is lot learn to get up to speed.
                This way of life is very different from my past life. Things changed very fast and I was not ready fo it. Consquently, I became frustrated.
                Bought things that I do not need, started going to places where I don't belong, started living like how I should not. 
                I had so many things that I thought that I loved, but the truth was I couldn't even appreciate any of it because there was too much. 
                <strong>Things were terrible.</strong> </p>
            <h3>How did i turned things around</h3>
            <p>How I turned things around I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything. 
                I literally  my unnecessary possessions in the garbage, and moved into a smaller apartment, 
                and I changed my job. Hardest of all was to change my company. It is hard to shine if company around you is not like-minded. The balance between work and life is also important. 
                 I have put atleast 2 hours for exercise and walking. keeps my mind fresh and healthy. Belive it or not, my productivity has increased significantly.
                It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place, I didn't know what else to do. And it worked. No need to complicate things, just keep it simple.
                Now that I'm living a simple life,
                 things are so much better.</p>
